I'm a Senior Engineer at Quicken Loans and a Microsoft Azure MVP. I've has been developing line of business applications for 15 years primarily in the Microsoft Stack, and have a passion for writing clean, scalable code and sharing what I've learned with others.

I also help run the [Casco Bay .Net User Group](http://www.meetup.com/CascoBayNUG/)

I will be blogging about technology, software development and anything else that moves me. I’ll largely focus on Microsoft products because that’s what I use day to day, but I will occasionally provide uninformed comments about other technologies…
