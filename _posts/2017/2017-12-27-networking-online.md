Which online social network is the best when looking for a new job? If you had asked me 2 weeks ago I would have told you it was LinkedIn, but it turns out LinkedIn is a distant second.

I have always maintained a bit of separation in my social networks. 

Facebook is for friends and family and a few people from the "*work world*" that I trust won't hold my occasional political rant against me. I almost never post anything work related there. 

LinkedIn is primarily just work-related folks. I post almost exclusively work related stuff here. Stuff I wouldn't mind prospective employers seeing.

Twitter is where I let the two worlds meet. I follow a broad range of people and I tweet personal, political, humorous and work stuff.

My expectation has always been that if I needed to find a job, my LinkedIn network would be the most valuable. And when it recently became apparent that my current employer wasn't going to work out long-term I posted the following on LinkedIn:

I also posted this similar message on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyone in need of of a Senior/Lead C# Developer with a load of experience in both Azure and AWS? I&#39;m primarily looking for remote.  A retweet might get the right eyes on this.</p>&mdash; Jeremy Hutchinson (@hutchcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/hutchcodes/status/938831065086681089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2017</a></blockquote>

The response from LinkedIn was OK, I guess.  few people liked it, a few of my former coworkers suggested positions at their current companies, and a recruiter contacted me, but never responded after I said I was only willing to make the 2hr drive to the office a few times a month.

The response on Twitter was overwhelming. A few people liked it, a bunch of people re-tweeted it, and total strangers contacted me about open positions that allowed remote. Most of those positions were at the companies they worked, but a few people pointed me to positions at companies they didn't work for but knew were hiring remote developers.

Twitter resulted in interviews with 3 companies that I'd be interested in working for.

### Why Twitter?

I'm just guessing here, but I think it comes down to two things:

1. Twitter is more active. I check LinkedIn just about once a week. And I rarely if ever scroll through the feed there.
2. Part of the Twitter experience is re-tweeting. Sharing posts is an option in LinkedIn, but it's not used as often.

### Takeaways 

* Build your Twitter network as best as you can. I've put work into providing some good content over the years to get to the number of followers I have. 
* Return the favor. When you see someone post that they are looking for work, retweet that. Same for companies looking to fill positions.
* Nurture the rest of your network too. Twitter was far more effective for me, but I did get some leads from LinkedIn, those came from people that aren't active on Twitter as far as I know. Those positions weren't interesting this time, but you never know what's going to come up.
