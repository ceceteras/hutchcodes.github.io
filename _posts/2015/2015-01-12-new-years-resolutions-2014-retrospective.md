title: New Years Resolutions 2014 - Retrospective
---
It's time for my annual resolutions blog post, but first I wanted to do a little retrospective to see how I did on <a title="New Year’s Resolutions 2014" href="/2014/01/new-years-resolutions-2014/">last year's resolutions</a>.

<strong><span style="color: #339966;">✓</span> Blog More</strong> - I did blogged <em>more</em>, but not as much as I had hoped.  Posts were still less than once per month.

<strong><span style="color: #339966;">✓</span> Find more ways to share knowledge</strong> - My talk at my local user group went well enough that I submitted and gave talks at the June Boston Code Camp, the Vermont Code Camp, and November Boston Code Camp.  I really enjoyed it, and I'm definitely going to continue.  I tried submitting talks to some bigger conferences but was not accepted.  I'll keep trying.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>X</strong><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>Networking</strong> - I got off to a good start, checking in with some people I hadn't spoken to in a while to see what they were up to, but I didn't continue it and I didn't really do anything to expand my network aside from chatting with some people at the code camps.</span></span>

<strong><span style="color: #339966;">✓</span></strong> <strong>Going to Bed Earlier</strong> - I mostly nailed this one.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">X</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>Lose weight</strong> - I did shed 5 pounds, and if I didn't change anything I think I'd lose another 5 this next year.</span>

So I was 3 for 5 last year.  I would list the year as a success overall.  I made progress, and I'm still heading in the right direction.
