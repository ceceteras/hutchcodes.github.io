title: New Keyboard Layout Progress Update
---
<p>Back in June I decided to change my keyboard layout with the hopes of increasing my typing speed. I have touch typed for 20 years on a QWERTY keyboard and was getting about 54 words per minute. First I tries Dvorak layout, but had a tough time even learning the keyboard never mind typing with any speed. Then I switched to the Colemak layout which I was able to get some speed on very quickly.</p><!--more-->

<p>I&rsquo;m currently typing at 60 words a minute. That&rsquo;s a 10% improvement, and I&rsquo;m sure there is still some speed left to be gained, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll ever make it to my original goal of doubling my typing speed. That would be 108 WPM, and at this point I&rsquo;d be thrilled with 80 WPM.</p>
<p>If I could go back, I&rsquo;m not sure if I would switch again. More speed was my original goal, and I think I could have increased my speed faster if I had done as much practice with QWERTY as I have done with Colemak. But here I am, I have switched and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be going back.</p>
<p>The Colemak layout is noticeably easier to type on. Much less reaching for common letters (I&rsquo;m looking at you E, R and T). My typing hasn&rsquo;t suffered too terribly on QWERTY keyboards, but I can no longer touch type, I have to watch the keyboard.</p>
<p>Up next on my experiments with typing, mechanical keyboards. I have noticed in my practicing that there are times when I&rsquo;m not sure whether I have typed a letter or not because of the mushy keys. I&rsquo;ll monitor my WPM before and after that switch when I finally fork over the money for a &gt;$100 keyboard.</p>
