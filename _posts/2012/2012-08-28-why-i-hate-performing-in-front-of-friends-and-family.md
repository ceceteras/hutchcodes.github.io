title: Why I hate performing in front of friends and family*
---
<p>*Not a technical blog, you&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>
<p>Over this last weekend we had our neighborhood block party.&nbsp; This year, my contribution was to plan the live music portion of the event.&nbsp; For this I was able to get 2 solo acts and a 3 piece band to commit to playing for "all the hot dogs they could eat."&nbsp;</p><!--more-->
<p>In the end one of the solo acts and the band couldn&rsquo;t make it due to family emergencies.&nbsp; To fill the gap I decided I&rsquo;d play a few tunes even though I previously decided to leave myself out of the show.&nbsp; I told myself it was because I hadn&rsquo;t been practicing for a year of so, but there was more to it.</p>
<p>I enjoy playing music.&nbsp; I like going down to an open mic with some friends and belting out a couple of tunes, and I always had fun performing in the band I was in a few years back, but I was really dreading playing music for my neighbors.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t the crowd, and it wasn&rsquo;t my neighbors friends, it was my neighbors that I didn&rsquo;t want to play in front of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that my neighbors are judgmental, mean, or anything like that.&nbsp; Quite the opposite, they are all great people and&nbsp; I knew the would be supportive even if I bombed.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t ask for better neighbors.</p>
<p>So why did I dread playing for them when I was perfectly comfortable going into a bar and playing for a bunch of strangers who always left an awkward silence where the polite applause are supposed to go?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 3 reasons I hate playing for friends and family:</p>
<ol>
<li>I respect their opinions.&nbsp; If I didn&rsquo;t respect their opinions, they wouldn&rsquo;t really be my friends would they.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t really trust their compliments.&nbsp; I know that if I bomb they probably won&rsquo;t tell me, they&rsquo;ll focus on the positive unless I press them for an honest opinion.&nbsp; I did that once, it confirmed what I already knew but it really sucked to hear it from someone I respected.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to see them again and again and again.&nbsp; The nature of strangers is that you rarely, if ever, see them again.</li>
</ol>
<p>So there it is, that&rsquo;s why I hate performing for friends and family.</p>
