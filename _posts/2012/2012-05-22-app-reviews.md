<p>A quick word about app reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people don&rsquo;t review. &nbsp;I average about 1000 ad impressions a day. &nbsp;In other words users are playing 1000 minutes a day. &nbsp;So there are people who are using Chess Tactics but are not reviewing it. &nbsp;There have been about 1500 downloads, and only 8 reviews in the US.</li>
<li>Most reviews are not that helpful. &nbsp;I have a handful of reviews that are on the low-end with no indication about what they don&rsquo;t like. &nbsp;Either they left it blank <!--more-->or just state they didn&rsquo;t like it. &nbsp;One Australian rated it a 1 star and commented that he wished he could give it zero stars.</li>
<li>Fixing complaints doesn&rsquo;t necessarily raise your rating. &nbsp;There were a couple of reviews that complained about having time factored into the scoring. &nbsp;I put out an update that allowed them the option to remove the time factor from the scoring. &nbsp;One reviewer did re-rate the app, but they left the negative part of the review, and just added that it was fixed at the end. &nbsp;The other reviewer hasn&rsquo;t changed his rating yet.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s hard not to take it personally. &nbsp;I worked hard on the app in my and the negative feedback is frustrating. &nbsp;I just have to keep in mind that even wildly successful products have a handful of people who think it&rsquo;s crap. &nbsp;Just take a look at the review for any product on Amazon.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I really wish was available through the review system was a way to reach out to those who did review the app, or respond to reviews. &nbsp;How nice would it be to attach a comment to a low review that disliked the time factor is scoring to let them and the world know that I took their feedback and fixed their issue. &nbsp;Or maybe it would be nice to email the user, but I understand that could open up an opportunity for abusing negative voters.</p>
<p>I did include a feedback email address in my app, and I have received responses from 2 users. &nbsp;One had a question about a particular problem, and the other suggested an option to keep the phone from sleeping (coming next release). &nbsp;I really enjoyed those interactions, and I hope there are more.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope this experience changes the way I review apps and give feedback. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s at all possible I will give specific feedback in the review. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll also try to follow-up with an email so they can let me know if they change what I didn&rsquo;t like about an app, so that I can adjust my review.</p>
