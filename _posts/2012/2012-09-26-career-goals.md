title: Career Goals
---
I've had a few people ask me over the last few weeks what my long term career goals are. The first time someone asked me, it caught me a little off guard. It's not a question I get asked a lot, and it's not something I've really given any thought to in the last few years. My answer was that I didn't have any career goals, that I was happy doing what I was doing.

####So, do I really not have any career goals?
<!--more-->

The more times I was asked about my career goals the more I became embarrassed by my answer. Why didn't I have any career goals? Shouldn't I have a goal? Without a goal aren't I just drifting through life? Then it finally occurred to me, I do have a career goal. It just doesn't involve moving up the corporate ladder. Or down, or across.

My goals* are:

1. Continue writing code
2. Continue learning and improving
3. Continue working with current technology

If I stop with #2, then I've failed at #3 and should probably stop with #1 for the sake of anyone who might have to maintain my code.

*I know these are not great goals as they are not measurable, but that's as close as I can get to good goals for my career. If you have suggestions for how I might clarify them please leave a comment.
