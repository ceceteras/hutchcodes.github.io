title: Minimum Requirements
---
<p>The Visual Studio team just <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2012/05/18/a-look-ahead-at-the-visual-studio-11-product-lineup-and-platform-support.aspx" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Visual Studio 11 will have the same hardware requirements as Visual Studio 2010. &nbsp;So, we&rsquo;re getting more features, they&rsquo;ve improved the performance throughout (yes, I am using it and the differences are obvious in places), and we could run it on yesterdays hardware, but we&rsquo;re likely to have upgraded since then so faster still.</p>

<p>This seems to be a trend at Microsoft, or at least I hope it is. &nbsp;Earlier this year (or was it at Build last September) they announced that they had improved the performance and memory usage in Window 8 to the point where it was faster than Windows 7, used less memory and that the minimum requirements wouldn&rsquo;t change from the Windows 7 minimums.</p>
<p>For so many years improvements in hardware were negated by bloat in software. &nbsp;If this trend continues we should be computing noticeably faster in a few years. &nbsp;Combine that with Microsoft&rsquo;s push around asynchronous programming and the user experience a few years from now could be vastly better than it is today.</p>
<p>Of course Microsoft can only do so much, it&rsquo;s now up to the world 3rd party and in-house developers to take up the challenge and write software that uses less memory, performs better and runs all long running processes asynchronously. &nbsp;Microsoft targeted processes that take longer than 50 ms, I might raise my target a bit above that, but I am accepting the challenge.</p>
