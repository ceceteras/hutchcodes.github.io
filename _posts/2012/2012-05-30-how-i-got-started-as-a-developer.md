title: How I got started as a developer
---
<p>A response to a <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SheLetMeTakeTheComputerHomeHowDidYouGetStartedInComputersAndProgramming.aspx">request</a> for everyone to share how they got started down the road to become software developer.</p>
<p>I wrote my first code on a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CF4QFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Foldcomputers.net%2Fkayproii.html&amp;ei=yQjGT-qXB4Sc8gTdo_WwBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMyF_ZnxtbNnnW-XZqyMNydNtbYA&amp;sig2=yQaiaF0Ohggcb2ZshkDElA">Kaypro II</a>.&nbsp; My mother bought it around 1987, and there were 2 things you could do on it.&nbsp; You could use the word processor (I think it was WordStar) or you could program in some variant of BASIC.&nbsp; I did a little of both.</p>

<p>My mother had a handful of programming books left over from getting her Associates degree a few years earlier, and I would copy some of the sample applications, or try to do some of the problems in some of the chapters.&nbsp; Between the things the books left out and the bugs I added while hunting and pecking the code into the computer I had plenty of debugging to do.&nbsp; In some ways I wish I had some of that code, but mostly I&rsquo;m glad the evidence has been destroyed.</p>
<p>Next my mother bought an IBM pc running Windows.&nbsp; My recollection was 3.1, but I&rsquo;m almost certain I got it before 1992 so who knows?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember how much ram it had, maybe a couple of MB?&nbsp; I do remember the disk was 25mb.</p>
<p>The first challenge with that was to try to get this one flight simulator running on it.&nbsp; I spent weeks modifying the autoexec.bat and config.sys on a boot disk to loaded the absolute bare minimum into memory and get every configured just right to be able that flight sim.&nbsp; Then I spent countless hours playing purchased and/or pirated games and playing in Q-Basic.</p>
<p>Around that same time I got a programmable calculator for my high school math class.&nbsp; I started writing programs to do the math problems for me.&nbsp; I still had to show the work, but I could be certain the answer was correct.&nbsp; I also created a simple black jack game and a two player howitzer game with random landscape and wind.</p>
<p>All that and I chose sports medicine as my major in college?&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp; How I got from sport medicine back to software development would be a whole post in itself.</p>
<p>So really, it was my Mom who got me started down this path.&nbsp; She not only bought the computers, but she taught me how to debug.&nbsp; How to work through the problems.&nbsp; How to go step by step until you see where things where things go wrong.&nbsp; Skills I still use every day.</p>
<p>Thanks Mom.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your story?</p>
