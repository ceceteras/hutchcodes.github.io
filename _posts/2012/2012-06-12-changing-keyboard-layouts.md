title: Changing Keyboard Layouts
---
<p>In my last <a href="http://hutchcodes.net/typing-speed/">post</a> I set a goal to switch to the Dvorak layout over the next few months and I&rsquo;m looking to double my typing speed.&nbsp; To do that, I am practicing typing on the Dvorak layout for a 10-15 minutes a day for a while and as my speed improves I&rsquo;ll add time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found that switching layouts is startlingly easy, so I thought I&rsquo;d share how to do it (instructions are for Windows 7 and may vary for other versions).</p><!--more-->

<p>Click Start and type &ldquo;intl.cpl&rdquo; into the search box.&nbsp; This will bring up the Region and Language control panel.&nbsp; Click on the Keyboards and Languages tab.</p>

<p>Click Change Keyboards</p>

<p>Click Add and select the keyboards you want to add.&nbsp; I just added United States-Dvorak.</p>
<p>Go to the Advanced Key Settings</p>

<p>From here you can assign Hot Keys to switch between layouts.&nbsp; If you highlight the &ldquo;Between input languages&rdquo; and click the Change Key Sequence, you alter what key combinations cycle between languages and keyboard layouts.&nbsp; I removed the cycle between languages because I only use US-English, and I assigned the Left Alt-Shift to cycle between keyboard layouts.</p>

<p>The last thing I did is back on the General tab, I went to the properties of the Dvorak keyboard and I changed the icon to a keyboard with a red border so that when my keyboard is in Dvorak mode the little Language Bar icon on the right side of the task bar is a read keyboard instead of the standard one.</p>
<p>QWERTY</p>

<p>Dvorak</p>

<p>No for the best part, or worst part, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure yet.&nbsp; When you switch layouts, the switch only affects the app you were in when you switched layouts.&nbsp; So, I can keep my browser in Dvorak for typing practice, but Outlook and Visual Studio stay in QWERTY.&nbsp; I think this will come in handy in the long run as I can keep a say Outlook in Dvorak, and Visual Studio in QWERTY or vice versa depending on productivity.&nbsp; Eventually I&rsquo;ll switch the default&hellip;</p>
