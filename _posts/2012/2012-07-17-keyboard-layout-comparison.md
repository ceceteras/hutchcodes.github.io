title: Keyboard Layout Comparison
---
<p>For the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve experimented with alternate keyboard layouts with the long-term goal of increasing my typing speed.</p>
<p>At first I tried Dvorak, which is the most popular alternative layout.&nbsp; I found it cumbersome to learn.&nbsp; Almost every key is in a new position.&nbsp; After a couple of weeks of practice I had mostly memorized the layout, but was still only typing at 16 WPM.</p>
<p>Then, while clearing out some bookmarks I found a link to the <a href="http://colemak.com/">Colemak</a> layout.<!--more--> I&rsquo;ve considered switching layouts for some time, so I wasn&rsquo;t surprised to find the bookmark.&nbsp; Like Dvorak, Colemak is designed for efficient and ergonomic touch typing in English.&nbsp; Unlike Dvorak, it is based somewhat on the QWERTY keyboard.&nbsp; Only 17 keys have moved.&nbsp; The transition was easy.&nbsp; I memorized the new layout in just a couple of days and was typing at 30+ WPM within a week.&nbsp; I seem to have stalled, but I think the issue now is learning to type words (or letter combos) instead of typing letter by letter.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s something I expect will come with time.</p>
<p>Here are my observation of the learning process:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a noticeable difference in how much finger movement is required compared with QWERTY.&nbsp; I hope this difference will result in more speed and comfort in the long run.</li>
<li>I had no problems switching between layouts until I was above 25 WPM on Colemak, then I started to get confused when on QWERTY.&nbsp; I switched to Colemak completely after I hit 30 WPM 2 days later.</li>
<li>My speed at a typing test seemed slower than regular typing when I tested on QWERTY, but I definitely copy text faster in Colemak than I type my own thoughts.&nbsp; This has improved since switching to Colemak full-time.</li>
<li><a href="http://play.typeracer.com/">TypeRacer</a> is a great place to practice.&nbsp; You race others in short (&lt;2 minute) races, and the quotes you type are at least somewhat interesting.&nbsp; It also tracks and graphs your progress.</li>
<li>Slow and accurate beats fast and inaccurate.&nbsp; If you mistype, it takes 3 strokes to make a letter.&nbsp; At 30 WPM you type 2.5 characters per second.&nbsp; You are better off spending the time to type the right letter the first time.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t type as much as I thought.&nbsp; With Visual Studio&rsquo;s Intellisense I only type 1 or 2 letter then press Tab to complete for most things.&nbsp; I honestly thought I typed more.</li>
</ul>
<p>A really cool tool for <a href="http://colemak.com/wiki/index.php?title=Compare">comparing keyboard layouts</a>.&nbsp; It calculates the distance traveled, percentage home row and some other stats to help illuminate the differences between layouts.</p>

<p>QWERTY is a clear loser here, its primary advantage is its monopoly.&nbsp; The relative merits of Dvorak vs Colemak are debatable.&nbsp; Are Colemak&rsquo;s higher home row percentage and lower same finger percentage worth the trade for higher same hand and bottom row percentage?&nbsp; Colemaks biggest advantage over Dvorak is the ease of learning if you are already proficient with QWERTY.</p>
