title: Why am I blogging? Because Scott asked me to
---
<p>Seriously, <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/" title="Scott" target="_blank">Scott</a> Hanselman, one of the premier software development bloggers and all around dev guru, asked me to blog. &nbsp;He wrote a whole <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourBlogIsTheEngineOfCommunity.aspx" title="blog" target="_blank">blog</a> post about how important he thought it was that I start blogging. &nbsp;It seems he really thinks I have something to add to the conversation, and that someday he will find answers to some of his questions when a Google search turns up my blog.</p> <!--more-->
<p>OK, so he wasn&rsquo;t speaking specifically to me, but I had been thinking about starting to blog because I&rsquo;m at a point where I do think I have something to add to the conversation, and I may actually be able to post about a coherent article on some problem I&rsquo;ve overcome that took researching 3+ pages deep in Google results for a hint that pointed me in the right direction.</p>
<p>Basically I was ready to start blogging, and Scott just pushed me over the edge. &nbsp;And for that I say thanks.</p>
<p>**I was watching a video of one of Scott&rsquo;s presentations where he said that he wants to beat out Scotts toilet paper as the top result when searching for Scott. &nbsp;To do that, he proposed that when linking to his site everyone link on the word Scott. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure if he was joking, but I went with it anyway.</p>
