This is a series I started where I'm listing out some tips for Visual Studio users. Each tip makes life just a little bit better, I'm hoping the mass of them will add up to a big difference. 

Unless otherwise noted all of these will work in the Community edition of Visual Studio.

1. [Debugger Display](/2019/03/visual-studio-tips-debugger-display/) - Control what value an object displays in the watch window
2. [$exception Pseudovariable](/2019/03/visual-studio-tips-view-uncaptured-exception/) - View the details of a caught but uncaptured exception.
3. [No Side Effect Function Evaluation](/2019/03/visual-studio-tips-no-side-effects-function-eval/) - Evaluate a function in the Watch or Immediate window without any side effects.


4. [Source Map Scroll Bar](/2019/03/visual-studio-tips-source-map-scroll-bar/) - See and navigate all the code in a file quickly in the scroll bar.
