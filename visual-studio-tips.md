This is a series I started where I'm listing out some tips for Visual Studio users. Each tip makes life just a little bit better, I'm hoping the mass of them will add up to a big difference. 

Unless otherwise noted all of these will work in the Community edition of Visual Studio.

2. [$exception Pseudovariable](2019/03/visual-studio-tips-view-uncaptured-exception/) - View the details of a caught but uncaptured exception.
