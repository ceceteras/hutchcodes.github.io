This is a series I started where I'm listing out some tips for Visual Studio users. Each tip makes life just a little bit better, I'm hoping the mass of them will add up to a big difference. 

Unless otherwise noted all of these will work in the Community edition of Visual Studio.

1. [Debugger Display](/2019/03/visual-studio-tips-debugger-display/) - Control what value an object displays in the watch window
2. [$exception Pseudovariable](/2019/03/visual-studio-tips-view-uncaptured-exception/) - View the details of a caught but uncaptured exception
3. [No Side Effect Function Evaluation](/2019/03/visual-studio-tips-no-side-effects-function-eval/) - Evaluate a function in the Watch or Immediate window without any side effects
4. [Source Map Scroll Bar](/2019/03/visual-studio-tips-source-map-scroll-bar/) - See and navigate all the code in a file quickly in the scroll bar
5. [Breakpoints](/2019/03/visual-studio-break-points/) - Advanced breakpoint features
6. [Solution Explorer Search](/2019/03/visual-studio-solution-explorer-search/) - Helpful features for searching in the Solution Explorer
7. [DataTips](/2019/04/visual-studio-tips-using-data-tips/) - You can do more with DataTips than just hover to view values.
8. [Tracepoints](/2019/04/visual-studio-tips-trace-points/) - Like Breakpoints, but they log to output and don't stop execution.
9. [Keyboard Shortcuts for Debugging](/2019/04/visual-studio-tips-debug-keyboard-shortcuts/) - Save a little time and stay focused on your code rather than hunting for that command.
10. [Window Management](/2019/04/visual-studio-tips-window-management/) - Setup your perfect tool window layouts, save them and switch between them.
11. [Test Explorer](/2019/04/visual-studio-tips-test-explorer/) - Sort, Group and Filter your unit tests so you can quickly run just the tests you need.
12. [Bulk Editing Shortcuts](/2019/04/visual-studio-tips-editing-shortcuts/) - Making a lot of repetitive changes? Here's a few shortcuts to make that easier.
13. [Code Definition Shortcuts](/2019/04/visual-studio-tips-code-definition-keyboard-shortcuts/) - Quickly get a look at the code you're referencing.
